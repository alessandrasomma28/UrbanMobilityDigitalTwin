This system embraces a knowledge-driven modeling approach, aspiring to construct a digital twin model for the manufacturing process, thereby enabling precise description, management, prediction, and optimization of the process. The core of this system lies in the comprehensive knowledge graph that encapsulates all pertinent information about the manufacturing process, facilitating dynamic modeling and iteration through knowledge matching and inference within the knowledge, geometry, and decision model. This approach not only ensures consistency across models but also addresses the challenge of coupling multi-source heterogeneous information, creating a holistic and precise information model. As the manufacturing process deepens and knowledge accumulates, the model's understanding of the process progressively enhances, promoting self-evolution and continuous optimization. The developed knowledge-decision-geometry model acts as the ontological layer within the digital twin framework, laying a foundational conceptual framework for the digital twin of the manufacturing process. Validated on an aero-engine blade production line in a factory, the results demonstrate that the knowledge model, as the core driver, enables continuous self-updating of the geometric model for an accurate depiction of the entire manufacturing process, while the decision model provides deep insights for decision-makers based on knowledge. The system not only effectively controls, predicts, and optimizes the manufacturing process but also continually evolves as the process advances. This research offers a new perspective on the realization of the digital twin for the manufacturing process, providing solid theoretical support with a knowledge-driven approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.;"Knowledge graph; Knowledge inference; Knowledge-based digital twin system; Knowledge-driven modeling approach; Manufacturing process";"Aircraft engines; Geometry; Industrial research; Knowledge graph; Optimization; Decision modeling; Geometry model; Knowledge based; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge inference; Knowledge model; Knowledge-based digital twin system; Knowledge-driven modeling approach; Manufacturing process; Modeling approach; Decision making";

DTs, representing virtual replicas of physical objects, products or processes established thanks to a bidirectional continuous flow of information between the physical and the virtual world, are currently adopted in multiple domains such as manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, energy, construction, smart cities and smart mobility, etc. DTs live together with the physical system they replicate, receiving the same data and often triggering specific control actions that directly impact on the real system status. When dealing with DTs of complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), the data sources may be heterogeneous and untrustworthy, which requires the DT to be able to address security issues related to data in transit from/to the physical twin and data at rest. A possible way to address these data security issues consists in adopting Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) which provide several security guarantees on data through cryptographic hashing techniques. In this work, we present a three-fold contribution: (i) we discuss the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the state-of-the-art of the research related to the integration between DLT and Digital Twins, aimed at clarifying relevant aspects such as, among others, what is the favourite DLT choice in existing proposals or what is the type of DT-related information to store on-chain; (ii) leveraging the SLR results and other related research, we propose an architectural framework for the integration of DT and DLTs (more specifically, blockchains); (iii) we validate the proposed architecture by means of two proof-of-concept implementations leveraging different technological stacks and taking into account two different operational scenarios. Finally, we conduct a requirements coverage analysis and compare the PoCs through a coverage matrix. © 2024 The Authors";"Blockchain; Data security; Data trustworthiness; Digital Twins; Distributed Ledger Technologies; Reference architecture";"Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Distributed ledger; Embedded systems; Network security; Virtual reality; Block-chain; Continuous-flow; Data trustworthiness; Distributed ledg technology; Physical objects; Physical process; Physical products; Reference architecture; Security issues; Systematic literature review; Blockchain";"All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

The current operation mode is facing the bottleneck of the increasingly significant production efficiency and performance. Digital twin (DT) technology realizes holographic visual management and control patterns using cyber-physical fusion and promotes the transformation of a port to an intelligent operation mode. In this paper, the framework of a digital twin application system is proposed based on the analysis of business characteristics of large-scale comprehensive ports. Construction methods and technologies such as digital twin modeling, global ubiquitous perception, data mapping, and model fusion are analyzed. With regard to the construction needs of Qingdao Port’s digital twin system, this paper presents a case study and illustrates the overall design process and function of the digital twin system for typical terminals. The system realizes the intelligent operation of the port with the core functions of three-dimensional visual monitoring and optimal dispatching based on real-time perception data. This paper serves as a feasible reference for future intelligent development of large ports and the application of digital twin technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2022.;"Cyber-physical system; Data mapping and fusion; Digital twin; Smart port; Ubiquitous sensing";"Embedded systems; Mapping; Production efficiency; Case-studies; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data mapping and fusion; Data mappings; Intelligent operations; Operation mode; Qingdao; Smart port; Ubiquitous sensing; Cyber Physical System";

More recently, Digital Twin solutions have been applied in the context of Smart Cities. Thanks to the large deployment of sensors, together with the increasing amount of information available for municipalities and governmental organizations, it is possible to build wide virtual reproductions of urban environments including structural data and real-time information that can undoubtfully help decision makers to face future challenges in urban development and improve the citizens' quality of life. In this paper, the Snap4City Smart City Digital Twin framework is presented, which can respond to the requirements identified in recent literature and by international forums. The proposed architecture provides an integrated solution for data gathering, indexing, computing, and information distribution, thus realizing a continuously updated digital twin of the urban environment at global and local scales for monitoring operation and planning. It addresses 3D building models, road networks, Internet of Things entities, points of interest, paths, as well as results from analytical processes for traffic density reconstruction, pollutant dispersion, predictions, and what-if analysis for assessing impact of changes, all integrated into a freely accessible interactive 3D web interface, enabling stakeholder and citizen participation to city decision processes. As case study, the digital twin of the city of Florence (Italy) is presented, including what-if analysis. The solution is released on top of the Snap4City platform as open-source and made available through our GitHub repository (https://github.com/disit) and as Docker compose.  © 2013 IEEE.;"3D city model; 3D web interface; digital twin; Internet of Things/Internet of Everything; ontology; smart city";"Data integration; HTTP; Internet of things; Interoperability; Ontology; Smart city; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional displays; Urban growth; 3d city model; 3d web interface; City model; Internet of thing/internet of everything; Ontology's; Solid modelling; Three-dimensional display; Urban areas; Web interface; Web-sites; Decision making";"All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

However, a universally adaptable research and development platform for digital twin is critically needed to meet the development requirements. Specifically, a publicly accessible simulation, testing, and validation platform which can support digital twin model building, data processing, algorithm design, configuration, etc., is urgently required for researchers. Furthermore, for developers from the industry, a low-code development platform that can offer a customizable suite of functions such as model creation, data management, protocol configuration, and visualization is urgently needed. Meanwhile, for enterprise users, there is a lack of an application management platform that can be configured and migrated for various application scenarios, functions, and modes. Therefore, based on the system research of digital twin theories and key technologies by the authors (such as the five-dimension digital twin model, digital twin modeling and digital twin data theory, digital twin standards, and so on), a digital twin software platform reference architecture, namely makeTwin, is proposed and designed, as well as its ten core functions. The workflow of the makeTwin and the interaction mechanisms among its core functions are described. Finally, a digital twin application system for a chemical fiber textile shop floor (CFTS) which was developed according to makeTwin, is introduced, which validates the proposed reference architecture. © 2023 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics;"Digital twin; Digital twin software platform; Industrial software; makeTwin; Reference architecture";"Data handling; Information management; Simulation platform; Conceptual research; Core functions; Development platform; Digital twin software platform; Industrial software; Maketwin; Reference architecture; Research and development; Software platforms; Theoretical research; Data visualization";"All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Managing the applications and services running in the space is a complex task as the operations of the devices and services are dependent on the physical characteristics of the space, the occupants of the space, and the technologies that are being integrated. Digital twinning, the combination of physical representations with a virtual counterpart, is a potential technology for facilitating the management of smart space devices and services. While digital twins are increasingly adopted in industry, their use in everyday environments remains low due to difficulties in creating and linking the virtual representation with the physical environment. In this article, we propose our vision for the adoption of digital twinning as a pathway to improve the functions of smart spaces. We derive a generic reference architecture that comprises four layers, covering the physical space, the sensing infrastructure, the network interfaces, and the underlying computational infrastructure. Next, we identify and address key requirements for the uptake of digital twins in smart spaces and assess their benefits using the ascendancy model of business analytics. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of digital twinning, we present a proof-of-concept digital twin for the TellUs smart space at the University of Oulu in Finland and use it to highlight the potential benefits of different ascendancy levels.  © 2014 IEEE.;"Digital twin; Internet of Things (IoT); long range (LoRa) networks; sensor networks; smart spaces";"Digital devices; Internet of things; Complex task; Intelligent sensors; Lora network; Physical characteristics; Potential technologies; Running-in; Sensors network; Smart space; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor networks";"All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

In this article, we introduce a conceptual architecture for IIoT anomaly detection based on the paradigms of digital twins (DT) and autonomic computing (AC), and we test it through a proof-of-concept of industrial relevance. The architecture is derived from the current state-of-the-art in DT research and leverages on the MAPE-K feedback loop of AC in order to monitor, analyze, plan, and execute appropriate reconfiguration or mitigation strategies based on the detected deviation from prescriptive behavior stored as shared knowledge.

Furthermore, achieving complex digital twins often requires the orchestration of technologies and paradigms such as machine learning, the Internet of Things, and 3D visualization, which are rarely seamlessly aligned in open-source solutions. In this paper, we present an open-source framework for the development of compositional digital twins, i.e., advanced digital twins that link individual entities or subsystems to create a higher degree digital twin, allowing knowledge sharing and data relationships. In this open framework, digital twins can be easily developed and orchestrated with 3D-connected visualizations, IoT data streams, and real-time machine-learning predictions. To demonstrate the feasibility of the framework, a use case in the Petrochemical Industry 4.0 has been developed. © 2023 The Author(s);"3D visualizations; Digital twin composition; Industry 4.0; Kafka-ML; Open-source digital twin framework";"Internet of things; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3D Visualization; Data relationships; Digital twin composition; Kafkum-ML; Knowledge-sharing; Machine-learning; Open source frameworks; Open-source; Open-source digital twin framework; Open-source solutions; Industry 4.0";"All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

The success of the integration depends on the design of the system. A Reference Architecture can be used as a blueprint to design Application Architectures rapidly and consistently for various application domains, resulting in a reduced time-to-market. Objective: The main objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a Reference Architecture designed using renowned software architecture methods. Method: A domain analysis was performed to gather and synthesize the literature on Digital Twin-based predictive maintenance systems, which we used to model the key features. We applied UML diagrams to design the reference architecture based on the feature model. We evaluated the reference architecture using three case studies. Results: We derived three views for Digital Twin-based predictive maintenance systems. For the user's view, we developed a context diagram. We developed a package diagram for the structural view, and we designed a layered view to show the system's decomposition in layers. We designed an Application Architecture for each case study based on the study's features using each Reference Architecture view. Additionally, we designed a deployment view to describe the hardware and software and its environment. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the methods of creating a Reference Architecture could be used in the Digital Twin-based predictive maintenance domain and showed how an Application Architecture could be designed in this context. © 2023 The Author(s);"Design; Digital twin; Framework; Predictive maintenance; Reference architecture; System architecture";"Maintenance; Application architecture; Applications domains; Case-studies; Design applications; Framework; Maintenance systems; Predictive maintenance; Reference architecture; Systems architecture; Time to market; Computer architecture";"All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

To facilitate the development of digital twins, various software platforms emerged in recent years, which often come with a certain architecture for the developed systems together with a set of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that help domain experts to configure the platform and implement the digital twins. This results in a set of architectures and DSLs which are currently used to realize the various concerns of digital twins. Thus, creating a comprehensive digital twin for a given system requires the combination of several architectures and DSLs, which is challenging as (i) the components of the different architectures have to be combined on a technological level, and (ii) the concerns specified with the different DSLs are developed in isolation which potentially leads to inconsistencies, especially during the evolution of digital twins.To tackle these challenges, we outline our vision of a product line architecture that explicitly specifies the different concerns of digital twins and their alignment on both, the technological level considering the different architectural elements as well as on the language level considering the different language elements. As a result, glue code that is currently required to compose the individual features together into particular digital twin systems is automatically generated. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach by (i) specifying an example product line architecture for selected structural and behavioral concerns of digital twins, and (ii) configuring an existing digital twin based architecture for self-adaptive systems based on this product line architecture by (iii) applying the selected platforms realizing these concerns to a smart room use case. Finally, we discuss expected benefits of the presented approach, such as plug-&-play of digital twin modules, as well as sketch out future work to realize the presented vision.  © 2023 IEEE.;"Digital twins; domain-specific languages; product lines; software integration";"Adaptive systems; Computer software; Digital subscriber lines; Embedded systems; Cyber-physical systems; Domains specific languages; Efficient interaction; Engineering domains; Physical systems; Product line architecture; Productline; Software integration; Software-systems; Technological level; Problem oriented languages";

However, there are challenges mentioned in the literature that must be addressed. One of the most important issues is the difficulty of collaboration of Digital Twins due to the lack of standardization in their implementation. This article continues a previous work that proposed a generic architecture based on the FIWARE components to build Digital Twins in any field. Our work proposes the use of Linked Open Data as a mechanism to facilitate the communication of Digital Twins. We validate our proposal with a use case of an urban Digital Twin that collaborates with a parking Digital Twin.

Based upon a terminological and conceptual discussion of digital twins and dataspaces, this paper claims that a systemic approach towards digital twin Systems is required. The key conceptual approach consists of a Reference Model for Digital Twin Systems (DTS-RM) and a hypothesis regarding a symbiotic evolution. The DTS-RM distinguishes between a digital twin back-end platform comprising the access and management of comprehensive digital twin instances and digital twin-related services, and digital twin front-end services that are tailored to the demands of applications and users. The main purpose of the back-end platform is to decouple the digital twin’s generation and management from the usage of the digital twin for applications. © 2022 by the authors.;"dataspaces; digital twin; digital twin system; digital twin system reference model; industrial Internet of things; Industry 4.0";;"All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.";"AutomationML; cyber-physical systems (CPSs); digital twin (DT); Industry 4.0 (I4.0)";"Computer aided software engineering; Digital storage; Digital twin; Industry 4.0; Life cycle; Deployment process; Hierarchical composition; Human Machine Interface; Implementation methodology; Industrial case study; Model-driven Engineering; Reference architecture; Virtual representations; Information management";

In practice, digital twins can be applied in different ways leading to different architectural designs. To guide the architecture design process, we provide a pattern-oriented approach for architecting digital twinbased Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To this end, we propose a catalog of digital twin architecture design patterns that can be reused in the broad context of systems engineering. The patterns are described using the well-known documentation template and support the various phases in the systems engineering life cycle process.
