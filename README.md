# Urban Mobility Digital Twin

This repository contains a small-scale implementation of a Digital Twin (DT) architecture for urban mobility, using FIWARE GEs as core components. The system simulates a real-world bus transportation network in a major Italian city, leveraging Automatic Passenger Counting (APC) systems and GPS data to monitor and predict bus occupancy and movements.
